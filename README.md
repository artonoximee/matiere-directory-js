# matiere directory - js version

## Introduction

This website is a personal experiment to understand and learn JavaScript in a real-case scenario. The main goal of this work is to understand the process of working with an API. The website's back-end is fully hosted with [Airtable](https://airtable.com/), and the content of the website is loaded via the Airtable API.

## Security

Since this is a fully client-side website, the Airtable API Key is stored in a readable JS file. This is a major security threat. However, the main goal of this work is to work on the website's front-end side. Moreover, [this process](https://support.airtable.com/docs/creating-a-read-only-api-key), described by Airtable has been followed in order to create an API Key that has a read-only access.

## Live version

An online version of this app is [available here](https://mlav.land/directory/).
